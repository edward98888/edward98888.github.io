     <strong> LYRIS </strong>
    <br><br>
    [Intro]<br>
    There's a girl, but I let her get away<br>
    It's all my fault 'cause pride got in the way<br>
    And I'd be lying if I said I was okay<br>
    About that girl, the one I let get away<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 1]<br>
    I keep saying no<br>
    This can't be the way it was supposed to be<br>
    I keep saying no<br>
    There's gotta be a way to get you close to me<br>   
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    (Now I know you gotta) speak up if you want somebody<br>
    Can't let them get away, oh no<br>
    You don't wanna end up sorry<br>
    The way that I'm feeling everyday<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken heart<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2]<br>
    There's a girl, but I let her get away<br>
    It's my fault 'cause I said I needed space<br>
    And I've been torturing myself night and day<br>
    About that girl, the one I let get away<br>
    I keep saying no<br>
    This can't be the way it was supposed to be<br>
    I keep saying no<br>
    There's gotta be a way<br>
    There's gotta be a way<br>
    To get you close to me<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    (You gotta) speak up if you want somebody<br>
    Can't let them get away, oh no<br>
    You don't wanna end up sorry<br>
    The way that I'm feeling everyday<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken heart<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken<br>
    <br>
    [Bridge]<br>
    No home for me<br>
    No home cause I'm broken<br>
    No room to breathe<br>
    And I got no one to blame<br>
    No home for me<br>
    No home 'cause I'm broken<br>
    About that girl<br>
    The one I let get away<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    So you better<br>
    Speak up if you want somebody<br>
    You can't let them get away, oh no no<br>
    You don't wanna end up sorry, oh no<br>
    The way that I'm feeling everyday<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken heart<br>
    (Don't you know)<br>
    No, no, no, no<br>
    There's no home for the broken<br>
    Oh<br>
    You don't wanna lose that love<br>
    It's only gonna hurt too much<br>
    (I'm telling you)<br>
    You don't wanna lose that love<br>
    It's only gonna hurt too much<br>
    (I'm telling you)<br>
    You don't wanna lose that love<br>
    Cause there's no hope for the broken heart<br>
    About that girl<br>
    The one I let get away<br>
