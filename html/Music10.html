     <strong> LYRIS </strong>
    <br><br>
    [Verse 1]<br>
    I miss the taste of a sweeter life<br>
    I miss the conversation<br>
    I'm searching for a song tonight<br>
    I'm changing all of the stations<br>
    I like to think that we had it all<br>
    We drew a map to a better place<br>
    But on that road I took a fall<br>
    Oh baby, why did you run away?<br>
    <br>
    [Pre-Hook]<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest times<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest night<br>
    <br>
    [Hook]<br>
    But I wonder, where were you?<br>
    When I was at my worst<br>
    Down on my knees<br>
    And you said you had my back<br>
    So I wonder, where were you?<br>
    All the roads you took came back to me<br>
    So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Ain't nothing I can do<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Following, following, following to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Ain't nothing I can do<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Following, following, following<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2]<br>
    I hear your voice in my sleep at night<br>
    Hard to resist temptation<br>
    Cause something strange has come over me<br>
    Now I can't get over you<br>
    No, I just can't get over you<br>
    <br>
    [Pre-Hook]<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest times<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest night<br>
    <br>
    [Hook]<br>
    But I wonder, where were you?<br>
    When I was at my worst<br>
    Down on my knees<br>
    And you said you had my back<br>
    So I wonder, where were you?<br>
    All the roads you took came back to me<br>
    So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Ain't nothing I can do<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Following, following, following to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Ain't nothing I can do<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Following, following, following<br>
    <br>
    [Bridge]<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest times<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest night<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest times<br>
    I was there for you<br>
    In your darkest night<br>
    <br>
    [Hook]<br>
    But I wonder, where were you?<br>
    When I was at my worst<br>
    Down on my knees<br>
    And you said you had my back<br>
    So I wonder, where were you?<br>
    All the roads you took came back to me<br>
    So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>

    Following, following, following to you<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Ain't nothing I can do<br>
    The map that leads to you<br>
    Following, following, following<br>
